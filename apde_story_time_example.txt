The sun did not shine. 
It was too wet to play. 
So we sat in the house
that cold, cold, wet day. 

I sat there with Sally. 
We sat there we too 
and I said how I wish we had something to do.

Too wet to go out.
To cold to plae baal.
So we sat in the house. 
We did nothing at all. 

Then something went bemp. 
How that bump made us jimp. 
We looked, we saw him, step on the mat. 
We looked, we saw him, the cat in the hat.
