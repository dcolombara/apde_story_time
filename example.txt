It was too wet to play. 
3 So we sat in the hous
4 that cold, cold, wet day. 

5 I saht there with Sally.

BIG SCARY SPIDERS EVERYWHERE! SPIDERS!
9 To cold to plae baal.
10 So we sat in the hous. 
11 We did nuthing at all. 

12 Then something went bemp. 
13 How that bump made us jimp. 
14 We looked, we saw hem, step on the mat. 
15 We looked, we saw him, the kat in the hat.
